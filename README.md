This is a custom web browser I made in C# (WinForms). I used Microsoft WebView2 to access the web, all the other features I coded myself.

It may not be much but at the time of publishing this I am a third year high-school student and this is my first project of this size. I am sure that I made some dumb mistake somewhere or I did not use the best practices but please bear with me while I am still learning :)

This project is most definitely not finished, there are a lot more features on my to-do list, but the main ones are done and it is usable.
